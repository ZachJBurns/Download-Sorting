# Downloads-Sorter

Downloads Sorter is a Python script to categorize your downloads folder to remove clutter for easier accessability of files.

## Usage

```
Update the DOWNLOADSDIR variable with the full path to your downloads folder.
You can edit the filesys variable to customize the names of your directories, and the file types that should be placed into it.

Run the script with "python sorter.py" in your terminal.

I recommend using a cron job to ensure your downloads folder is organized often.
